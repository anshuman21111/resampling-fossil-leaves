## Brief introduction to the project ##
Ecological networks, especially bipartite networks, have played an important role in understanding major patterns in modern plant-insect interactions.  These same quantitative tools are starting to play such a role in paleo-ecological plant-insect interactions. For example, my co-authors and I introduced the usage of bipartite networks to represent fossil plant-insect interactions (Swain et al., 2021 in Paleobiology). We further showed that the metrics obtained from these networks can help us in understanding patterns in the structure of these interactions over evolutionary time and across major environmental events (Currano et al., 2021 in Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology). 

Although network metrics have been useful in disentangling interesting ecological signals, they are prone to sampling bias. This especially problematic in the case of fossil plant-insect interactions as sampling effort and sample sizes are limited in paleontological settings. In this paper, we systematically investigate the sensitivity of various bipartite network metrics to sample size, identifying which ones are least sensitive to sampling bias and therefore most useful in understanding plant-insect interactions. We use a compilation of data from 61 different fossil assemblages from last 70 million years and sampled from across the world to achieve our objective. Through our extensive statistical explorations, we demonstrate that network metrics tend to be more robust to variation in sampling effort than various richness-based metrics, which have traditionally been used in studies of fossil plantâ€“insect interactions. 

Our discoveries about the robustness of bipartite network metrics have implications throughout ecology, because these same metrics are used to study plant-herbivore interactions, plant-pollinator interactions, and other systems of interacting species.
